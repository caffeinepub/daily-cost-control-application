  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented via global CSS changes to make Radix Select dropdowns scrollable with a fixed max-height and touch scrolling. REQ-1 is partially evidenced by new admin-mode state/validation and a separate mutation call that submits explicit player1/player2 principals, but the truncated diff does not show the actual UI rendering (labels/selectors) to confirm the full acceptance criteria. REQ-2 cannot be verified from the truncated backend diff; frontend hooks reference a new admin submission flow, but the corresponding backend entrypoint is not evidenced.",

      "requirement": "Admins/score-auth-admins must see two separate member selectors labeled \"Player 1\" and \"Player 2\" in the Tournament -> Enter Scores tab, while non-admin users retain the existing opponent-only UX.",
      "reason": "The diff shows admin-mode state (player1/player2) and branching submission logic, but the file is truncated before the JSX that would prove the presence of two labeled selectors and the preserved non-admin UI.",
